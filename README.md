# ML_SIG

This repository contains topics that are covered in each SIG along with the resources.

## What Is SIG?
SIG is Special Interest Group. In each meeting of SIG people share their knowledge with everyone else.
We distribute topics related to Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence among 
ourselves every week, everyone read about their topic and understand it well. On the day of weekly 
meeting, everyone teach their topics to those who are interested and what to learn.
This is a initiative taken by [Shyamal Vaderia](https://github.com/svaderia) and [Arka Talukdar](https://github.com/atalukdar).
